Hey ShaiUI,

Apologies for the unorthodox contact method, this is the only way I could find in order to reach out.

I've watched some of your programming videos and not many people I see that I can near 100% agree with in terms of programming philosophy.

Are you open to contract, part-time or full time remote work per chance? I'm not a recruiter, i'm a software engineer working on a new project that we just got funding for and would love to work alongside someone like yourself.

Let me know if you are open to reaching out, either way would be great to keep in touch.

I really do enjoy your videos.
